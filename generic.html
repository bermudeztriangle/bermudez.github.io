								<p>Hello! My name is Adrian Bermudez and I grew up in the town of Palmdale, California. I am studying aerospace engineering at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.</p>
								<p>I am a curious and outgoing person who loves spending time with friends and family. I love challenges and view setbacks as opportunities for growth. I strive to achieve my goals and forge meaningful connections.</p>
								<p>When I'm not immersed in the world of aerospace, you'll find me pursuing an array of thrilling hobbies:</p>
								<ul class="hobbies-list">
  								<li>Basketball: I love the energy and teamwork involved in sports, and they keep me physically active. Lakers fan!</li>
  								<li>Music: Playing drums, guitar, and bass allows me to express myself creatively and unwind.</li>
  								<li>Photography: Capturing moments and creating visual stories through photography is one of my passions. I took all of the pictures that you see on my portfolio! (Except for the ones of me)</li>
  								<li>Video games: I personally love racing and Star Wars games. I'm a big Nintendo fan as well. Gamecube was my first console!</li>
  								<li>RC aircraft: As an avid hobbyist, I've built and flown RC aircraft, fostering my interest in aerospace. RC aircraft helped me win first place in my high school's science fair!</li>
  								<li>Paintballing: Playing adrenaline-pumping paintball matches provides an outlet for my competitive side.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Beyond my hobbies and studies, I value continuous growth and learning. As a Star Wars enthusiast, I'm inspired by the limitless possibilities of the universe. My ultimate goal is to become my family's first aerospace engineer, contributing to the advancement of technology and pushing the boundaries of space exploration. I strive to be the best version of myself, constantly challenging myself to acquire new skills and knowledge.</p>
								</ul>

					<p>As mentioned, I like to take photos. The photos above are of me and my brother taking pictures at Palmdale's Blackbird Air Park (left) and the other picture (right) is a picture that I took of the Thunderbirds at the Edwards Air Force Base Air Show. The photos below are of me and a couple of my favorite hobbies.</p>
