Hello there! My name is Adrian Bermudez and welcome to my portfolio!

As a university student, I am looking for any internships or jobs that will help me further my knowledge in the field of aerospace engineering (my major). In so doing, career fairs and meet-and-greats are things that I would participate in. Some recruiters required a portfolio along with a resume to be a part of the recruiting process which knocked me out of contention for a few of these opportunities. I found that using a website developer online would cost money so I decided to use an HTML template online so that I could code the portfolio myself. Hopefully, with the help of this website, I am able to show off my skills, dedication, and what I can  I really hope you enjoy it and please bear with me if I made any mistakes. However, if you do find something out of place, please let me know so that I can fix it right away.  

This is my first time playing with HTML code and css to write and program a website. Using an HTML template, I was able to modify the code through Visual Studio Code so that I can personalize the website to my liking and make it my own. I used GitHub Pages to make an online link address for the website.
